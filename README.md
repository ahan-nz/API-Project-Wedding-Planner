### R1 Identify the problem you are trying to solve with this app

The purpose of this app is to simplify and organise the task of wedding planning. The aim is make this often stressful task a better experience by giving brides and grooms a starting point on brainstorming and planning for their big day, and having the details all in one place; the app can also be used by professional wedding planners to track vendors for their clients. For the purposes of this assignment the scope has been limited, however there is potential to scale and add more features such as catering or florists.

### R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Wedding planning can be a huge and daunting task with many variables, and most brides and grooms have little experience with event planning. There are a multitude of choices such as venues, catering and vendors, which can be difficult to track. In addition, wedding planners can be very costly, which can be unattainable for many couples who may be stretching their budget for the wedding.
