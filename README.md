### R1 Identify the problem you are trying to solve with this app

The purpose of this app is to simplify and organise the task of wedding planning. The aim is make this often stressful task a better experience by giving brides and grooms a starting point on brainstorming and planning for their big day, and having the details all in one place; the app can also be used by professional wedding planners to track vendors for their clients. For the purposes of this assignment the scope has been limited, however there is potential to scale and add more features such as catering or florists.

### R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Wedding planning can be a huge and daunting task with many variables, and most brides and grooms have little experience with event planning. There are a multitude of choices such as venues, catering and vendors, which can be difficult to track. In addition, wedding planners can be very costly, which can be unattainable for many couples who may be stretching their budget for the wedding. 

### R3 Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?

### R4 Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM

### R5 Document all endpoints for your API

### R6 ERD

### R7 Detail any third party services that your app will use

### R8 	Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships they have with each other



### R9 Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application



### R10 Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project

I initially brainstormed ideas for a project on paper, and chose the most practical one to propose on Discord for educator approval.

I also formed a rough idea of the entities and relationships during this, which acted as the basis for my ERD.

I am utilising Trello to help me track tasks throughout this project, with lists based on a Kanban board template, including:

* User Stories

This is where I started to think about the end goals of the application. I created several user stories from the point of view of the user, which is the bride/groom/wedding planner in this case. These will help with the planning stage of the application and ensure I start with the end in mind.

* Backlog

This is a list of tasks that I have yet to start on. It helps me to plan and clarify the exact tasks that I need to complete. This will also include tasks that may be out of scope for this assignment that I can work on in future, including adding other vendors such as florists or wedding dress fittings.

* In Progress

These are the tasks that I am currently working on, it's useful not only for tracking my progress but also to make sure I don't have too many cards in this list at the same time. It would also be useful if I were working in a team so we are update to date with each others' progress.

* Review

These are the tasks that I have completed but yet to finalise. For example my ERD card went here once I finished the initial plan, but it may be subject to change. It may also include code that I've written but yet to be tested fully.

* Done

These are tasks that I have completed and no longer need to revisit.
